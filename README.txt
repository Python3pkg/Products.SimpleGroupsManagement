Introduction
============

Have you ever feel the need to give to normal (AKA non-manager) Plone member the power to manage a group?
Right now Plone can't make this possible even playing with the permissions of the portal.

This products make something very dangerous: with a minimal configuration a member of the Plone portal
(or all members in a group) will be able to manage the users of a group.

Also you can make he able to add new users to the portal and to the group.
He can't give roles to new users.

Be aware!
